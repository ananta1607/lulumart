# Simple Single-Page EcoShop

This is a minimal single-page e-commerce demo built with plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

Files:
- `index.html` — the single page UI
- `styles.css` — styles
- `script.js` — product rendering and cart logic (uses `localStorage`)

Run locally:
1. Open `c:\Users\GEU\Desktop\j\index.html` in your browser (double-click or `Ctrl+O`).
2. Browse products, add to cart, and click Checkout (no real payments).

Notes:
- Cart is persisted in `localStorage` under the key `sp_ecom_cart`.
- Images are loaded from `https://picsum.photos` as placeholders.

Want changes?
- I can add product data file, improve styling, or wire a fake backend. Tell me which.
